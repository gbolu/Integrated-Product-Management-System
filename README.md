# Integrated-Product-Management-System

This tool consists of a bug/issue tracker and a task management system. The bug tracker enables end-users to submit bug reports and denote their severity etc. The task manager allows project managers to create tasks, from reported bugs or feature requests, assign tasks based on devs performances and abilities and observe metrics to award dev performances and automate new task assignments.
